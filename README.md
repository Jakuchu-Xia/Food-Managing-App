## Food Managing

***Why this project is of interest to me?***

Cooking for yourself can save you a lot of money, 
but for those who don't have extensive cooking and food shopping experience, 
managing food could be a huge problem. Every food has a different storage condition and expiration date. 
If food is not managed, it is likely to be wasted. 
So I want to develop an application that can save energy and time in this matter.

***What will the application do?***

Whenever new food is purchased, users can record its price, storage conditions, expiration date, etc. 
Used food can be removed. 
To better manage the food, 
users can divide foods by storage conditions, and the time they have left until the expiration date. 
Finally, the app can calculate food costs for the month.

***Who will use it?***

Users of the app can be people who are busy and don't have much of a food budget.
